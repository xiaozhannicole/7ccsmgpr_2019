\subsection{Scoring Assessment and Conflict Resolution}

\noindent We agree on distributing the marks by using Berger Algorithm. Which is every group member will give a point to others, according to those points, the final mark will assign in proportion. If the member failed to do his task after hard working, it is understandable. But if he denied to, he will get fewer points and the points will give to a member who help finish it. Members did not participate will get fewer points than others.
