\noindent In summary, our main purpose is to develop a multi-host file synchroniser.
 The function of this synchronizer is to make it possible to edit the same files across multiple computers in a sensible way. This synchroniser can satisfy the multiple clients access and edit the data in a single central server. In this group project, our final result is to develop a server and two clients, one for desktop and another for mobile.

\noindent In this section, we first clarify in detail the works we need to do, and the specific strategies we should use to develop this synchroniser. In addition, we will also provide a clear time-line showing each step we will complete in the coming period. At the end of this section, we will summarize the work we have done so far and the specific progress.
