\noindent We have held three meetings since the establishment of our team. In these three meetings, we discussed the purpose of the project and the skills and knowledge required to implement them. In addition, we share some of the information and experience we have. Because each team member has a different background and different areas of expertise, we have completed a simple task division based on your situation and agreed to continue to carry out the work of the team while filling in the gaps, so that we will not delay the project schedule. Moreover, we also created a simple synchronizer demo based on the original project idea(which will be shown in the presentation). At present, we can initially achieve the simultaneous editing of two web-end users, but the deeper usage of the OT algorithm and the development of the iOS are still in the exploration stage. For this synchronizer, we intend to implement the core functions first. For some additional functions, we will try our best to enrich and improve them under the premise of sufficient time.
