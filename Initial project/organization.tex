\subsection{Task Assignment and Cooperation Plan}
\noindent Our main aim is that we can work for this group as fair as possible in a friendly, welcome environment. In order to this team works efficiently, we have decided we would regularly meet once a week and take notes in the meeting. Therefore we can discuss what issues may occur and find out the solution. Notes can keep track of what we have discussed and make documents easier to construct. Also, we will communicate with each other instantly through chatting application to update progress. The most importantly, we will study related technology together and talk about our project every week, cooperate with each other and contribute their ideas to the group. Everyone will write part of the initial report and the final report. One or two members will demonstrate the presentation.
